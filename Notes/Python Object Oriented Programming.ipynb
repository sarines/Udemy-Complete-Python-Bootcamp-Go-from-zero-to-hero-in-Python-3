    "2. To do so, we call the class's `__init__` method with the proper number of arguments (minus self, which we'll get to in a moment)\n",
    "3. So, to use the \"blueprint\" that we created by defining the `class Customer` (which is used to create Customer objects), we `call the class name almost as if it were a function: jeff = Customer('Jeff Knupp', 1000.0)`. This line simply says \"use the Customer blueprint to create me a new object, which I'll refer to as jeff.\"\n",
    "4. The `jeff object`, known as an `instance`, is the realized version of the `Customer class`. Before we called Customer(), no Customer object existed. **We can, create as many Customer objects as we'd like**. There is still, however, **only one Customer class, regardless of how many instances of the class we create**\n",

    "    2. So when we say `def withdraw(self, amount):`, we're saying, \"here's how you withdraw money from a **Customer object (which we'll call self)** and a dollar figure (which we'll call amount). `self` is the **instance of the Customer that withdraw is being called on**\n",
    "6. `__init__`: when we call `__init__`, we initialize objects by saying things like `self.name = name`\n",
    "    Since **self is the instance**, this is **equivalent to** saying `jeff.name = name`, which is the same as `jeff.name = 'Jeff Knupp`. Similarly, `self.balance = balance` is the same as `jeff.balance = 1000.0`. After these two lines, we consider the Customer object \"initialized\" and ready for use.\n",
    "7. After __init__ has finished, the caller can rightly assume that the object is ready to use; **fully initialized object**\n",
    "8. The rule of thumb is, **don't introduce a new attribute outside of the __init__ method**, otherwise you've given the caller an object that isn't fully initialized. This is part of a larger concept of object consistency: there shouldn't be any series of method calls that can result in the object entering a state that doesn't make sense."
